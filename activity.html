        <h2>My Research</h2>
        <p>
            Collective behavior is a fundamental characteristic of active matter, including bacterial colonies, confluent tissues, and engineered active agents. 
            Understanding these collective phenomena is key to advancing both biological insights and technological innovations. Chemically active agents, 
            such as Janus colloids and active droplets, are at the forefront of self-organized active materials research. Despite extensive experimental observations, 
            the underlying self-organization mechanisms remain a significant challenge, driving ongoing research efforts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary goal of my PhD research project at the National University of Singapore (NUS) is to understand the mechanisms governing these self-organizations. 
            This involves employing theoretical modeling and numerical simulations to investigate the role of hydrochemical interactions in suspensions of: 
            (i) two-dimensional (2D) active droplets, and (ii) three-dimensional (3D) Janus colloids.
        </p>

                In this work, we demonstrate remarkably that, tuning the activity of a phoretic active medium alone can shape its solid-liquid-gas phase transitions and subsequently, trigger laminar-turbulent transitions in fluid phases. 
                We present our findings by examining suspensions of isotropic chemically-phoretic agents through large-scale, agent-resolved simulations that explicitly account for their many-body, long-range hydrochemical interactions.

                Particles that propel themselves naturally gather in areas where their motion is slower. At higher concentrations, their movement can be further hindered by biochemical factors or physical crowding. 
                This dynamic establishes a reinforcing cycle, often resulting in motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where distinct dense and sparse fluid regions form. 
                In this work, we perform the fully resolved 3D numerical simulations to understand: can MIPS of Janus particles occurs in the presence of hydrodynamical interaction?
